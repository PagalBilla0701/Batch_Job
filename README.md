Hello Sindha,

Apologies for the delayed response. I had to log off early yesterday around 5 p.m. due to an emergency, and I’ll be attending a camp outside of Kuala Lumpur for a short time. So far, I’ve completed around twelve methods for the JUnit tests. For the remaining methods, I’ll aim to complete them by this Wednesday.

Thank you for your understanding.

Regards,
Kaushik
