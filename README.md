     Here's how the JUnit-focused user story points would look with the title, description, and acceptance criteria formatted:


---

JUnit Story Point 1: Testing DTO Classes

Description: Write unit tests for the Data Transfer Object (DTO) classes to ensure they encapsulate data correctly, support serialization, and maintain field integrity. These DTO classes play a key role in transporting data across different layers, so it is essential to verify each field's behavior, serialization compatibility, and null safety.

Acceptance Criteria:

Each field in the DTO classes should have a corresponding getter and setter test to confirm proper data handling.

Serialization tests should confirm that the DTOs can be correctly converted to and from JSON (or XML), maintaining data integrity.

Tests should validate that mandatory fields cannot be null, ensuring data completeness and consistency.

JUnit Story Point 2: Testing Authentication and Endpoint Services

Description: Create JUnit tests for service methods responsible for token generation and endpoint configuration. These services handle critical tasks like generating tokens for CTOM authentication and configuring endpoint URLs, which are essential for secure and reliable communication with external systems.

Acceptance Criteria:

getAccessToken tests should cover successful token generation, as well as error handling for cases like invalid credentials or token expiration.

Tests for getCTOMEndPointURL should ensure it accurately returns the expected URL for different environments.

getReponseEntityforCTOM should be tested for response handling, covering scenarios such as successful, error, and timeout responses.

JUnit Story Point 3: Testing Data Access Layer for CRM and Call Activity

Description: Develop unit tests for Data Access Object (DAO) methods to verify accurate data retrieval, edge case handling, and database interaction for CRM and call activity data. This layer is crucial for retrieving and storing customer interaction data, so tests must ensure data integrity and handle various input conditions.

Acceptance Criteria:

getCallActivitiesList should return correct results with mocked data and support pagination, filtering, and handling empty or null datasets.

DAO methods for CallButtons, CustIndicators, and GenesyscallActivity should be tested for accuracy and resilience.

Tests for DynamicRoutingDataSource should verify that it routes to the correct database based on different input parameters.



---

JUnit Story Point 4: Testing Service and Web Layer Integration

Description: Write JUnit tests for the service and web layer integration methods that manage Genesys requests and CTOM interactions. These methods are vital for the smooth operation of Genesys call activities and outbound call workflows, so they must handle both successful and error scenarios effectively.

Acceptance Criteria:

GenesysRequestData should accurately parse and validate incoming Genesys requests, ensuring data integrity and error-free processing.

invoke, getopenComplaintsCount, and getCTOMSummarywrapper should return correct results under both normal and exceptional conditions, with error handling for failed requests.

Each method should be tested with mock dependencies to ensure proper integration with backend services.

This format organizes each JUnit user story point with a clear focus on test objectives and success criteria, making it easier to track and validate each testing task.
