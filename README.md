   Subject: Progress on Writing JUnit Test Cases for Service-Level Classes

Hi Sindha,

As per my discussion with Selva, I have been advised to focus on writing JUnit test cases for the service-level classes. Since there are a lot of service classes to cover, Selva suggested that I start by picking 2-3 classes and write test cases for them.

I plan to write 4-8 test cases per day for the selected classes. To begin with, I have chosen 3 classes, which contain 68, 50, and 30 methods, respectively. I will proceed with the CollectedServiceImpl class first, and once I complete this, I will move on to the others.

Please find the attachment for further details.

Let me know if you need any additional information.

Best regards,

Hi Sindha,

I wanted to update you on the JUnit test cases I’m working on, as discussed with Selva. Since there are quite a few service-level classes to cover, Selva suggested I start by picking 2-3 classes and focus on writing test cases for them.

For now, I’ve selected three classes with 68, 50, and 30 methods. My plan is to write 4-8 test cases per day, starting with the CollectedServiceImpl class. Once I finish this, I’ll move on to the next ones.

I’ve attached more details for your reference. Let me know if you need anything else or have additional suggestions!

Best regards,
Kaushik
