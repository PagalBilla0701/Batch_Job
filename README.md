Subject: Clarification on SR Status and Pagination Details

Hi Uday,

I hope you're doing well.

I have a couple of questions regarding the SR request:

1. How can we determine the SR status (e.g., whether it is open) from the request payload? Could you guide me on how to identify this?


2. Regarding pagination, the request payload includes a page number. Could you please confirm how many total pages we can expect to get the complete SR request data?



Your clarification on these points would be really helpful.

Looking forward to your response.

Thanks and regards,
Kaushik
