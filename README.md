Subject: Issue with Call Delays and Difficulty in Task Concentration

Hi Sindha,

I wanted to bring up an issue I’ve been experiencing with the current call process. For every call, after typing CTI_TEST and clicking, there’s a wait time of around 18 to 20 seconds for the call to start. Additionally, when I click mute, it takes another 10 to 15 seconds to activate. Overall, each call is consuming around 1 to 2 minutes just on these delays.

These delays are also impacting my focus, as I find it difficult to concentrate on other tasks effectively due to the interruptions. Sometimes I’m even added to the call late, which adds to the disruption.

Could we look into ways to reduce these wait times, or possibly automate some of the repetitive actions? This could save a considerable amount of time per call and improve productivity.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
