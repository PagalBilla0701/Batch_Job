Subject: Medical Emergency and Upcoming Surgery

Dear Ponepriya,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I am dealing with a medical emergency concerning my ear and nose. After consulting with my doctor, it has been advised that I undergo surgery on Monday, 14th October.

Following the surgery, my doctor has recommended a recovery period of one week to ensure proper healing. Therefore, I will need to take time off from work starting from 14th October until 21st October.

I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding and support during this time. All required documents, including the prescription, have been provided for your reference. I will also submit any additional documents post-surgery if needed.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Kaushik Singh
